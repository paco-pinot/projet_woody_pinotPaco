Woody is a simple and responsive website focused on woodworking. It was created as part of my training at Molengeek. This website features two main pages: Home and Contact. It incorporates responsive design, hover effects, Google Maps integration, and includes placeholders for two contact forms and a newsletter input field (please note that all the forms are not operational in this version).
